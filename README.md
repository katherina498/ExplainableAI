Here is the code for my final report for the course Explainable AI.

#Breast Cancer Prediction and Explanation with SHAP and DiCE
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model that classifies breast cancer data as benign or malignant using a Random Forest classifier. The code also integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for explaining the modelâ€™s predictions and DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations) for generating counterfactual explanations.

# Installation steps
To run this code locally, ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed and the following libraries:

Dependencies are pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, shap and dice-ml.

# Dataset 
The dataset is a version of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset that contains features extracted from digitized images of breast cancer biopsies. The target variable diagnosis has two classes:

M (Malignant): Represented as 1

B (Benign): Represented as 0
